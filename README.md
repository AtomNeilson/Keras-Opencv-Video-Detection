# Keras-Opencv-Video-Detection

well, This is a real time Face Detection and Classification. It's still a bit buggy. I'm still working on it.
Still not the best one. This classifier uses a (100,100) sized images which is kind of slow for the video feed.
The video is gonna lag too much. 

Few bugs and Issues are there. 
- If the face is not detected, the classifier will take a random cropped frame and try to classify it which is not good.

Better version - date(5/12/2017)
It will get uploaded after some days.
