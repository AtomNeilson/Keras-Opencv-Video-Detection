# Keras-Video-Gender-Classification

A Neural Network based Face Detection system with classification of Males and Females.

It uses a 100 pixels frame and classifies it as a Male or Female.

Classifier_v1.4
- This code uses the Screen Capture method to take the frame from the window and perform Classification.

Video_detection_v1.2
- This code uses the webcam or any camera attached to your pc and performs Classification.

The image data for Male and Female is stored in the file "MF_dataset.npy" and use numpy to extract the image data.

At the moment, The dataset used to train the model is small and the neural network model, itself is a small one so wouldn't be as powerful as you might expect it to be but feel free to change and use the model for your own purposes.

This project is an extension of "Image Gender classifier" and its training model is in there
